Folder to store common codes.

Files were mainly used for producing TAUP plots with count rates of gamma lines for different cuts. 
A comparison with GERDA results are present too.

Report any unusual behaviour if running these codes (and always pay attention to change possible paths/values within them).
In the future, they'll be generalized if necessary.
